jpa xstream dump was invented to convert 
live data from one JPA data source to another 
using a combination of late model xstream 
hibernate fixes and introspection driven 
model details.

integrate Dump.java into your project and 
supply a hibernate/jpa Entitymanager (only 
tested flavor)

when main is run it will dump the data to 
stdout per the persistence.xml file which 
is parsed independantly from the JPA backend 
parser.
